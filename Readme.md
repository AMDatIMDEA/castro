It has the following functionality:
 - sampling with space coverage for mixture and other synthesis constraints
 - uses divide and conquer approach for problem of dimension greater than 4, divide problem into subproblems and later reassemble
 - find n_des experiments to conduct for exploration of the design space under a limited budget and taking the previously collected experimental data into account
 - pre- and post-process data
 - calculation of uniformity metrics
 - visualization of results

## Installation

You can install CASTRO by simply cloning or downloading the repository, installing the packages in the requirements.txt file, and then installing CASTRO. First, create a virtual environment called castro_env via:
    virtualenv castro_env
Then activate the virtual environment by:
    source castro_env/bin/activate
Next you can install castro in this virtual environment:
    cd <installation directory>
    git clone https://github.com/AMDatIMDEA/castro.git
    cd castro
    python setup.py install

Note: if it does not succeed the first time, try to rerun:
    python setup.py install
