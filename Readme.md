It has the following functionality:
 - sampling with space coverage for mixture and other synthesis constraints
 - uses divide and conquer approach for problem of dimension greater than 4, divide problem into subproblems and later reassemble
 - find n_des experiments to conduct for exploration of the design space under a limited budget and taking the previously collected experimental data into account
 - pre- and post-process data
 - calculation of uniformity metrics
 - visualization of results

## Installation
Before installing CASTRO, you need to install git and a Python version (tested for 3.13).

You can install CASTRO by simply cloning or downloading the repository, installing the packages in the requirements.txt file, and then installing CASTRO. This was tested for python 3.13.

First, create a virtual environment called castro_env via:
    - virtualenv castro_env
or:
    - python3 -m venv castro_env
Then activate the virtual environment by:
    - source castro_env/bin/activate

or with Anaconda (Windows) in the Anaconda prompt to create a virtual environment:
- conda create -n myenv python=3.13
Then to activate it:
- conda activate myenv

- Next you can install castro in this virtual environment:
    - cd "installation_directory"
    - git clone https://github.com/AMDatIMDEA/castro.git
    - cd castro
    - pip install -e .
