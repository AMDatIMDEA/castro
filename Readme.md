It has the following functionality:
 - sampling with space coverage for mixture and other synthesis constraints
 - uses divide and conquer approach for problem of dimension greater than 4, divide problem into subproblems and later reassemble
 - find n_des experiments to conduct for exploration of the design space under a limited budget and taking the previously collected experimental data into account
 - pre- and post-process data
 - calculation of uniformity metrics
 - visualization of results

## Installation

You can install CASTRO by simply cloning or downloading the repository, installing the packages in the requirements.txt file, and then installing CASTRO. This was tested for python 3.13.
- First, create a virtual environment called castro_env via:
    - virtualenv castro_env
- or:
    - python3 -m venv castro_env
- Then activate the virtual environment by:
    source castro_env/bin/activate
- Next you can install castro in this virtual environment:
    - cd "installation_directory"
    - git clone https://github.com/AMDatIMDEA/castro.git
    - cd castro
    - pip install -e .
